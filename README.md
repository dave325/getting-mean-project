# getting-mean-project
A project following the guidelines of the book Getting Mean by Simon Holmes
Uses Mongo, Express, Angular, and NodeJS to create a functional locator app that searches mongo database for nearby locations and then allows users to add reviews and login/logout. App uses predefined locations because database is not fully updated with locations. 
Code was tested using realtime location and was successful.
